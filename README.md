# 🛟 LifeSaver Agent  
Automation that cares — built for life’s unexpected moments.

## 🧠 What is LifeSaver Agent?  
**LifeSaver Agent** is an emergency-aware automation assistant designed to quietly take over your digital chaos when life gets in the way — whether it's a health issue, travel disruption, or a family emergency.

This no-code solution was built during the **AI & Automation Hackathon** hosted by SparkUp AI and Zapier, and it’s just the beginning of a truly human-first automation experience.

## ✨ What It Does  
Trigger LifeSaver Agent with a simple message like:

> “Flight got canceled, I’m stuck at the airport. Can’t make it to today’s meetings.”  
> “Family emergency came up, I won’t be available today. Please inform the team.”  
> “I’m in an emergency situation and need help handling my schedule.”

The bot then handles everything:

✅ Classifies the emergency using AI  
✅ Sends alerts to your team or manager on Slack  
✅ Updates your Slack status to show you're away  
✅ Cancels or reschedules your meetings via Google Calendar  
✅ Sends auto-replies from Gmail  
✅ Creates a “Recovery Plan” checklist in Notion or Trello  
✅ Sends you a kind message reminding you to rest 💙

## 🔌 How You Can Trigger It  

You can activate the agent through:

- 📋 **Google Form submission**  
- 💬 **Slack DM**  
- 📱 **WhatsApp message** (via Twilio)

Just type your message, and LifeSaver Agent takes over.
